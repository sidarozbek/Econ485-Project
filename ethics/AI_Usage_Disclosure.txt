AI USAGE DISCLOSURE

This project was developed with the support of an AI-based tool (ChatGPT) used strictly as a
technical assistant during the following stages:

- Entity–Relationship (ER) diagram design and data modeling discussions,
- Conversion of conceptual models into MySQL-compatible database schemas,
- Generation of synthetic (non-real) data for testing purposes,
- Development and refinement of SQL queries,
- Technical clarification and troubleshooting during the implementation process.

All modeling decisions, database design choices, analytical approaches, and interpretations
of results were made by the author. The AI tool did not independently generate conclusions
or make autonomous decisions.

The use of AI was limited to assistance and guidance, and the final responsibility for the
content, structure, and conclusions of this project belongs entirely to the author.
