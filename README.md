# Student Demand–Focused Real Estate Market Analysis (MySQL)

This project analyzes the **impact of student demand on local real estate markets**
using a **MySQL-based relational database**. The study focuses on how student presence
affects **rental prices, sales prices, payback (amortization) periods, and investment
attractiveness** across different regions.

Rather than treating housing demand as a homogeneous structure, the project explicitly
models **students as a distinct demand group** with unique characteristics such as high
mobility, short rental cycles, and sensitivity to rental affordability.

## Research Focus

The central research question of this project is:

> **How does student demand influence real estate market dynamics and investment returns
at the regional level?**

The analysis investigates whether:
- regions with higher student demand exhibit different rent and sale price patterns,
- student concentration shortens payback periods for property investors,
- student-driven demand stabilizes markets with high housing supply,
- a measurable student-related rent premium exists compared to non-student regions.

## Project Scope

The project was developed for **academic purposes** and includes:

- transformation of qualitative field observations into structured data,
- Entity–Relationship (ER) modeling of student-focused housing demand,
- implementation of a MySQL-compatible database schema,
- generation of realistic but synthetic data,
- development of analytical SQL queries centered on student demand,
- investment-oriented evaluation of real estate markets.
